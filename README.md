# Sharp3D.Math
**Sharp3D.Math math library**

Sharp3D.Math contains fundemental classes to dealing with numerics on the .NET platform. It contains various mathematical structures such as vectors, matrices, complex numbers and contains methods for numerical integration, random numbers generation and other object-oriented numeric functions.

Note: The original developper of Sharp3D is Eran Kampf (http://ekampf.com) and the original repository can still be found on codeplex (http://sharp3d.codeplex.com/) althought the project seems abandoned.
Some forum users claimed that the original inspiration for Sharp3D was a Java library which was denied by original author Eran Kampf.
treeDiM only added a few classes (transformations) to match the needs of project PLMPack Lib and PLMPack StackBuilder.

**Features**
* Fully compatible with the .NET CLR making the library usable from any .NET language.
* Support for both single and double precision computations.
* Vector, Matrix, Complex numbers and Quaternions structures.
* Geometric data types and algorithms for 2D and 3D - distance and intersection methods, bounding volumes computation etc.
* Random numbers generation from various distribution probabilities.
* Classes for encapsulating unary functions with support for numerical integration and differentiation.
* Fully persistable data structures using standard .NET mechanisms.
* Strong-typed collections for library's data types.
* Support for conversion between the library's data structures and DirectX\GDI+ structures.
